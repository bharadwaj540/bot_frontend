## Coding
- We have created frontend for  this chatbot by writing  [html](https://github.com/Vamsi-027/FrontEndForBot/blob/main/index.html) file. In which we have created a structure for out bot.Its a very basic html code anyone can easily understand.This file is mainly divided into three parts they are
    1. Header
    2. Main Body
    3. Footer
- In [css](https://github.com/Vamsi-027/FrontEndForBot/blob/main/style.css) file we have styled our html file.
- In [JavaScript](https://github.com/Vamsi-027/FrontEndForBot/blob/main/script.js) ,there are 6 different functions they are
    1. talk()
    2. user_msg_append()
    3. bot_msg-append()
    4. evall()
    5. joke()
    6. scrolldown()
